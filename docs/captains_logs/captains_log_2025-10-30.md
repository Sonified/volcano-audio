## Architecture Documentation Updates

Updated `docs/FULL_cache_architecture_w_LOCAL_DB.md` with key architectural decisions:

### Changes Made:

1. **Self-Describing Filenames with Sample Rate**
   - Format: `{NETWORK}_{STATION}_{LOCATION}_{CHANNEL}_{SAMPLE_RATE}Hz_{START}_to_{END}.bin.zst`
   - Example: `HV_NPOC_01_HHZ_100Hz_2025-10-24-00-00-00_to_2025-10-24-01-00-00.bin.zst`
   - Supports fractional sample rates (e.g., `40.96Hz`)
   - Filenames now contain ALL metadata needed for identification
   - Perfect for IndexedDB keys (no need for full path)

2. **Phased Metadata Format**
   - **Phase 1 (Current)**: Single metadata file with per-chunk gap summaries (~8-15 KB)
   - **Phase 2 (Future)**: Split gap details into separate `*_gaps.json` file (lazy-loaded)
   - Keeps main metadata small while preserving detailed gap audit trail option

3. **Implementation Priorities**
   - **Priority 1**: Update Render backend to write correct metadata format
   - **Priority 2**: Implement metadata flow through R2 Worker and Browser
   - **Priority 3**: Implement IndexedDB local cache layer
   - Pins for future testing/decisions kept minimal (no premature architecture decisions)

### Version
v1.20 - Commit: "v1.20 Docs: Updated cache architecture with self-describing filenames (includes sample rate), phased metadata format, and implementation priorities"
