## 🌋 Volcano Audio Streaming Interface - Complete Refactor

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. **Streaming Interface Refinements** ✅
- **Fixed critical race condition**: Old audio's `onended` callback was setting `isPaused=true` after new stream started, preventing spectrogram from running
- **Implemented real-time playback speed control**: Speed changes apply immediately to currently playing audio
- **Fixed pause/resume functionality**: Now properly pauses audio using `audioContext.suspend()` and resumes with `audioContext.resume()`
- **Implemented seamless audio looping**: Queue-based playback with automatic restart when loop is enabled
- **Fixed button state management**: Buttons now properly disable/enable and maintain state during stream loading

#### 2. **UI/UX Improvements** ✅
- **Dynamic button colors**: 
  - Pause (playing): Reddish gradient `#ee6766 → #c44ba2`
  - Resume (paused): Greenish gradient `#66ee9a → #4ba27c`
  - Loop ON: Purple gradient `#667eea → #764ba2` (matches Start Streaming)
  - Loop OFF: Grey `#6c757d`
- **Fixed button sizing**: Added `min-width` to prevent layout shifts when text changes
- **Repositioned CHUNK indicator**: Moved to right of speed slider to prevent UI jumps
- **Added volcano emoji favicon** 🌋
- **Reordered volcano list**: Mauna Loa moved below Kilauea

#### 3. **Performance Optimizations** ✅
- **Smart animation control**: Spectrogram only draws when audio is actively playing
- **Canvas context caching**: Eliminated repeated `getContext()` calls (60/sec → 1)
- **DOM lookup caching**: `spectrogramCanvas` cached to avoid repeated `getElementById()`
- **Pause optimization**: Animation loops explicitly stop when paused, resum when playing
- **Added `willReadFrequently: true`**: Eliminated Canvas2D performance warnings

#### 4. **Audio State Management** ✅
- **Comprehensive state logging**: Added debug logs for `isPlaying`, `isPaused`, and queue state
- **Fixed start streaming behavior**: New streams properly clear old audio and reset state
- **Fixed button state during streaming**: Buttons disable during load, re-enable when ready
- **Proper cleanup**: `stopAllAudio()` now clears spectrogram canvas for visual feedback

## 🚀 Cloudflare R2 Integration - SUCCESS!

### R2 Setup & Testing ✅

#### Configuration
- **Account ID**: `66f906f29f28b08ae9c80d4f36e25c7a`
- **Bucket**: `hearts-data-cache`
- **Token**: `hearts-data-r2` (Object Read & Write permissions)
- **Endpoint**: `https://66f906f29f28b08ae9c80d4f36e25c7a.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`

#### Scripts Created
1. **`test_r2_connection.py`**: Validates R2 connectivity and lists objects
2. **`upload_to_r2.py`**: Uploads zarr directories to R2 with proper structure
3. **`test_r2_download.py`**: Comprehensive download tests (direct, s3fs, xarray)
4. **`test_r2_simple.py`**: Simple chunk download/decode (production-ready approach)

#### Test Results
- ✅ **Connection successful**: Authenticated with S3-compatible API
- ✅ **Upload successful**: 13.68 MB zarr (43 files) uploaded in seconds
- ✅ **Download speed**: **5.87 MB/s** (1.37 MB chunk in 0.234s)
- ✅ **Decoding successful**: int32 → float32 conversion working perfectly
- ✅ **8 chunks available**: ~360,000 samples each (1 hour @ 100 Hz)

#### Key Learnings
- **Account ID ≠ Token Name**: Initial confusion resolved - token name is just a label
- **Object Read & Write sufficient**: Don't need admin permissions for our use case
- **Skip zarr libraries**: Direct boto3 approach simpler and faster for our streaming use case
- **Raw chunks work great**: Data stored as int32, converts cleanly to float32 audio

#### Dependencies Added
```
boto3>=1.28.0
s3fs>=2023.10.0
xarray>=2023.10.0
zarr>=2.16.0
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready to implement)
1. **Integrate R2 into Flask backend**:
   - Add cache check before IRIS fetch
   - Upload processed data to R2
   - Serve from R2 when available

2. **Implement cache key strategy**:
   - Format: `{volcano}/{network}.{station}.{channel}/{date}/{hour}.zarr`
   - Example: `kilauea/HV.UWE.HHZ/2025-10-22/14.zarr`

3. **Add cache management**:
   - TTL for cache entries (e.g., 7 days)
   - Cache cleanup utility
   - Cache hit/miss metrics

### Future Enhancements
- **Pre-cache popular volcanoes**: Background job to keep recent data warm
- **Smart compression**: Test different compression codecs for optimal size/speed
- **CDN integration**: Add Cloudflare CDN for edge caching
- **Monitoring**: Track R2 bandwidth usage and costs

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **SSL Handshake Errors**: Initially tried to disable SSL, realized problem was using token name instead of Account ID
2. **Access Denied**: Token permissions were Object R&W (correct), but `list_buckets()` requires admin - skipped unnecessary operation
3. **Zarr v3 Format**: Zarr libraries expect v2 - solved by using direct boto3 approach instead
4. **Audio Race Conditions**: Old audio `onended` callbacks interfering with new streams - fixed with careful state management
5. **Playback Speed Timing**: Initial approach broke chunk scheduling - refactored to use `onended` chaining

---

## Performance Metrics

### R2 Download Speed
- **Single chunk**: 1.37 MB in 0.234s = **5.87 MB/s**
- **Expected for 1 hour**: ~11 MB in ~2 seconds
- **Comparison to IRIS**: R2 likely 5-10x faster for repeated requests

### Browser Performance
- **Canvas optimization**: ~60 `getContext()` calls/sec → 1 call total
- **Animation efficiency**: Only runs when audio playing (saves CPU when paused)
- **Memory**: Cached chunks allow instant replay without re-fetch

## Quotes of the Day

> "WAAAAIT! Hah... umm... our other tests.. I think they may have used a more optimized rendering pipeline?"

> "STOP! Don't disable SSL - the issue isn't SSL validation. `hearts-data-r2` is your TOKEN NAME, not your Account ID!"

> "FAIL SO HARD. Wow... that was so fuckign stupid. revert that shit and then Ill tell you why"

## 🧪 Progressive Chunk Streaming Test (Evening Session)

### Test Infrastructure Created ✅

#### 1. **Test Plan Documentation** 
- Created `docs/progressive_chunk_test_plan.md`
- Documents test objective: Compare 6 storage/compression variants
- Progressive chunk sizes: 8→16→32→64→128→256→512 KB
- Test data: 4 hours Kilauea, 12 hours ago
- Storage variants: raw vs zarr
- Compression: int16 (none), gzip (level 1), blosc (zstd-5)

#### 2. **Backend Endpoint: `progressive_test_endpoint.py`** ✅
- Fetches from IRIS → Saves all 6 formats to R2
- Streams with progressive chunk sizes
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Changed from download-all-then-stream to true streaming
  - **Before**: `data = response['Body'].read()` (downloads 2.75 MB, THEN streams)
  - **After**: `r2_stream.read(chunk_size)` (streams chunks as they arrive from R2)
  - **Impact**: TTFA should drop from ~700ms to ~20ms

#### 3. **Test Scripts Created**
- `tests/test_progressive_chunks.py`: Tests all 6 variants, measures TTFA, decompress time
- `tests/test_http_compression.py`: Tests HTTP-level compression vs no compression

### Test Results (Localhost)

**First Test Run** (with download-all bug):
- **Raw int16 + No Compression**: 2.75 MB, TTFA 15,575ms (IRIS fetch), 0.0ms avg decompress
- **Zarr + No Compression**: 2.75 MB, TTFA 702ms (R2 cached), 0.0ms avg decompress
- **Compressed variants FAILED**: Can't progressively decompress pre-compressed files!

**Key Findings**:
1. ✅ First request fetches from IRIS (~15s) and caches to R2 in all 6 formats
2. ✅ Subsequent requests use R2 cache (fast!)
3. ❌ Pre-compressed data can't be split into progressive chunks (blosc/gzip failed)
4. ❌ Backend downloads entire file from R2 before streaming (700ms delay)

**Solution**:
- Store raw int16 in R2
- Use HTTP-level compression (Flask-Compress) for bandwidth savings
- Stream directly from R2 (fixed in this commit)

### Files Modified
- `backend/progressive_test_endpoint.py` - Fixed streaming bug (lines 207-258)
- `docs/progressive_chunk_test_plan.md` - NEW: Test documentation
- `tests/test_progressive_chunks.py` - NEW: Progressive chunk test script
- `tests/test_http_compression.py` - NEW: HTTP compression test script
- `python_code/__init__.py` - Version bumped to v1.05

---

## v1.05 Commit Summary

**Fixed critical R2 streaming bug**: Backend now streams chunks directly from R2 instead of downloading entire file first. Expected TTFA improvement: 700ms → 20ms.

Next: Deploy to Render and test real-world performance.

---

## v1.06 Deployment Fix

**Problem**: Render deploy failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xarray'`

**Root Cause**: R2/zarr dependencies were added to `backend/requirements.txt` but Render uses root `requirements.txt`

**Fix**: Added missing dependencies to root requirements.txt:
- boto3>=1.28.0
- s3fs>=2023.10.0
- xarray>=2023.10.0
- zarr>=2.16.0
- numcodecs>=0.11.0

**Lesson**: Always test local server startup AND check which requirements.txt Render uses before pushing!

---

## v1.07 Configuration Cleanup

**Problem**: Confusion about which requirements.txt to use, bloated production deps

**Solution**: Created clear separation with render.yaml

**Changes**:
1. **Created `render.yaml`**: Explicitly tells Render to use `backend/requirements.txt`
2. **Split requirements**:
   - `backend/requirements.txt` - Production only (Flask + R2, no matplotlib/jupyter)
   - `requirements.txt` - Local dev (includes matplotlib, jupyter, ipywidgets for notebooks)
3. **Added clear comments** in both files explaining the split

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Faster Render builds (no matplotlib, jupyter)
- ✅ Clear documentation (render.yaml is self-documenting)
- ✅ Future AI agents can read render.yaml to understand deployment
- ✅ Local dev still has all tools needed for notebooks

**Files**:
- NEW: `render.yaml` - Render deployment config
- MODIFIED: `requirements.txt` - Now local dev deps (matplotlib, jupyter, etc.)
- MODIFIED: `backend/requirements.txt` - Production lean deps only
- MODIFIED: `python_code/__init__.py` - v1.07
