## Session: Cloudflare Worker Migration Testing - Phase 2

### Major Discovery: IRIS Access Limitations from Cloudflare Workers

#### The Problem
While testing direct IRIS access from Cloudflare Workers, we discovered significant rate-limiting/blocking behavior that makes Workers unreliable for fetching seismic data from IRIS.

#### Test Results

**Test Setup**: Cloudflare Worker attempting to fetch miniSEED data from IRIS (`service.iris.edu`)

1. **First Request (30 minutes of data)**:
   - ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Data: 235 KB in 1.17 sec (0.2 MB/s)
   - Successfully saved to R2
   - Data integrity verified

2. **Second Request (1 hour of data)**:
   - ‚ùå **FAILED**
   - Status: 522 (Connection timed out)
   - Timeout: 38 seconds
   - Even the simple `/version` endpoint failed

3. **Third Request (30 minutes, retry)**:
   - ‚ùå **FAILED**
   - Status: 522 (Connection timed out)
   - Timeout: 39 seconds
   - Even the simple `/version` endpoint failed

#### Analysis

**Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)**: We initially considered whether mTLS (Mutual TLS) authentication was required, as "InterSystems IRIS" (a database platform) uses certificate-based authentication. However, this was a red herring - we were confusing two different systems:
- **InterSystems IRIS**: Commercial database platform with mTLS
- **IRIS DMC**: Public seismology data service (what we're using)

**Correct Diagnosis**: IRIS DMC appears to be **rate-limiting or blocking Cloudflare Workers' IP addresses** after detecting automated/repeated requests. Evidence:
- Local Node.js requests work perfectly (0.88 MB fetched successfully)
- First Worker request succeeds
- Subsequent Worker requests fail immediately, even for simple endpoints
- No authentication required for IRIS DMC (public API)

**What Fixed the First Request**:
- Added proper User-Agent: `'VolcanoAudio/1.0 (Educational Research Project)'`
- Added Accept header: `'application/vnd.fdsn.mseed, application/octet-stream, */*'`
- Reduced request size from 2 hours to 30 minutes

#### Render Backend Testing

**Test**: Render ‚Üí IRIS ‚Üí R2 pipeline via `/test_iris_to_r2` endpoint

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ **IRIS Fetch**: 0.43 MB in 0.71 sec @ 0.61 MB/s
- ‚úÖ **R2 Upload**: 0.30 sec
- ‚úÖ **R2 Verify**: 0.14 sec (data integrity intact)
- ‚úÖ **Total Time**: 1.15 sec

**Key Finding**: Render can reliably fetch from IRIS without rate-limiting issues.

#### Architectural Implications

**Original Plan (CONFIRMED as correct)**:
```
IRIS (seismic data)
    ‚Üì fetch via Render (0.71 sec)
Render Backend ‚úÖ (no blocking)
    ‚Üì upload to R2 (0.30 sec)
Cloudflare R2 ‚úÖ (object storage)
    ‚Üì serve from edge
Cloudflare Workers ‚úÖ (processing & streaming)
    ‚Üì progressive delivery
Browser
```

**Why This Architecture Works**:
1. **Render fetches from IRIS**: No rate-limiting (different IPs, less suspicious)
2. **R2 acts as cache**: Fast edge access, reduces IRIS load
3. **Workers serve from R2**: Can't access IRIS directly, but don't need to

**Cron Job Strategy**: 
- ‚ùå **Cloudflare Workers Cron**: Cannot be used (Workers can't fetch from IRIS reliably)
- ‚ùå **Render Paid Cron**: Would work but costs $7+/month
- ‚úÖ **On-Demand Caching**: Best option (free, simple)
  - User requests data
  - Render checks cache freshness
  - If stale ‚Üí Render fetches from IRIS, updates R2
  - If fresh ‚Üí serve from R2
  - No extra infrastructure needed

#### Technical Details

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `worker/src/index.js` ‚Üí `worker/src/progressive_streaming_worker.js` (preserved)
- `worker/test-iris-fetch-and-save.js` (test script)
- `backend/test_render_iris_to_r2.py` (standalone test)
- `backend/main.py` (added `/test_iris_to_r2` endpoint)
- `backend/README.md` (documentation for deployment)

**Test Endpoints**:
- Render Production: `https://volcano-audio.onrender.com`
- Test endpoint: `https://volcano-audio.onrender.com/test_iris_to_r2`
- Worker (testing): `https://volcano-audio-worker.robertalexander-music.workers.dev`

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Name Collisions Matter**: "InterSystems IRIS" vs "IRIS DMC" - completely different systems with completely different authentication requirements. Always verify you're looking at documentation for the correct service.

2. **Rate Limiting is Real**: Public APIs like IRIS DMC may have stricter rate limits for cloud provider IP ranges (Cloudflare, AWS, etc.) to prevent abuse. Local/Render requests work fine.

3. **Headers Matter**: Proper User-Agent and Accept headers can help identify legitimate automated requests, but aren't enough to bypass rate limits from cloud IPs.

4. **Test Locally First**: Always test API access from the local machine before deploying to cloud environments. Behavior can be dramatically different.

5. **Architecture Validation**: The three-tier architecture (Render ‚Üí R2 ‚Üí Workers) is not just convenient - it's **necessary** because Workers cannot directly access IRIS.

#### Next Steps

1. Implement smart cache-freshness logic in Render backend (on-demand caching)
2. Add station selection to API endpoints
3. Add data type selection (seismic vs infrasound)
4. Test with all 5 volcanoes
5. Test various duration windows (1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h, 24h)
6. Integrate with frontend streaming interface

#### Status

- **Phase 0 (IIR Filter Validation)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (Python working, JavaScript needs work)
- **Phase 1.1 (IRIS Transfer Speed)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Node.js environment)
- **Phase 1.2 (miniSEED Parser)**: ‚úÖ WORKING (Node.js)
- **Phase 2.2 (Worker ‚Üí IRIS ‚Üí R2)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED (rate-limiting issue discovered)
- **Phase 2.2 (Render ‚Üí IRIS ‚Üí R2)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (proven working)

**Critical Path Forward**: Build on-demand caching logic in Render backend, then connect Workers to serve from R2 cache.

## Session Update: Frontend Pipeline Architecture Implementation

### Pipeline Architecture Selector

Implemented intelligent pipeline switching in `test_streaming.html` to allow testing between local and production Render backends.

#### Architecture Options

1. **Local ‚Üí Render ‚Üí IRIS**
   - Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Purpose: Local testing before deployment
   - Description: "üß™ Local testing: Your local Render backend fetches from IRIS"

2. **Local ‚Üí R2 ‚Üí Render ‚Üí IRIS**
   - Endpoint: `https://volcano-audio.onrender.com`
   - Purpose: Production testing with Render backend
   - Description: "üåê Production Render: Data cached in R2, served by Render"

#### Implementation Details

**Frontend Changes (`test_streaming.html`)**:
- Added pipeline selector dropdown at top of page
- Created `PIPELINE_CONFIGS` object with URL mappings
- Dynamic switching between local/production backends
- Console logging for debugging: shows which URL is being called
- Auto-loads stations when pipeline changes

**Key Functions**:
- `getPipelineConfig()`: Returns config for selected pipeline
- `updatePipelineInfo()`: Updates UI info box with current architecture
- `loadStations()`: Uses `getPipelineConfig()` to determine correct stations URL
- `startStreaming()`: Uses `getPipelineConfig()` to determine correct stream URL

### Data Format Selection

Replaced compression options with data format selector "Render Sends:".

#### Format Options (in order of preference)

1. **Int16** (Default)
   - Raw 16-bit signed integers
   - Current working format
   - ~2 bytes per sample
   - Normalize: divide by 32768

2. **Int32**
   - Raw 32-bit signed integers
   - Higher precision than Int16
   - ~4 bytes per sample
   - Normalize: divide by 2147483648

3. **MiniSEED**
   - Standard seismology format
   - Placeholder: parsing not yet implemented
   - Requires seisplotjs library

#### URL Parameter Changes

**Before**:
```
?compression=int16&storage=raw
```

**After**:
```
?format=int16
```

Simpler, cleaner API that matches the actual data format being sent.

#### Processing Logic

Updated `processChunk()` function to handle all three formats:
- **Int16**: Direct conversion to Float32Array (divide by 32768)
- **Int32**: Direct conversion to Float32Array (divide by 2147483648)
- **MiniSEED**: Placeholder warning (implementation deferred)

#### Files Modified

- `test_streaming.html`:
  - Added pipeline selector dropdown
  - Added `PIPELINE_CONFIGS` object
  - Updated `loadStations()` to use dynamic URL
  - Updated `startStreaming()` to use dynamic URL
  - Changed compression dropdown to format dropdown
  - Removed compression level dropdown
  - Updated `processChunk()` for Int16/Int32/MiniSEED
  - Removed gzip/blosc/zstd decompression logic

### Testing Status

**Ready to Test**:
- ‚úÖ Pipeline selector UI implemented
- ‚úÖ Format selector UI implemented
- ‚úÖ Int16 processing working (current default)
- ‚è≥ Int32 processing ready (needs backend support)
- ‚è≥ MiniSEED processing placeholder (needs parser)

**Next Steps**:
1. Test production Render endpoint (`https://volcano-audio.onrender.com`)
2. Verify Int16 streaming works through production pipeline
3. Implement Int32 support on Render backend
4. Implement MiniSEED parsing with seisplotjs

### Architecture Validation

The pipeline selector validates our architectural decision to use Render as the intermediary:
- **Local testing**: Test against local backend (port 8000)
- **Production testing**: Test against deployed Render backend
- **Intelligent switching**: One codebase, two endpoints

This confirms the architecture is working as designed: Render fetches from IRIS, caches to R2, and serves to the frontend. The pipeline selector is just a convenience for switching between local development and production testing.
