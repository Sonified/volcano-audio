## üî¨ Phase 0: IIR Filter Validation & Audification Testing

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. **Master Testing Plan Created** ‚úÖ
- **Created comprehensive migration plan**: `docs/planning/volcano_audio_master_testing_plan.md`
- **Goal**: Migrate from Render backend to Cloudflare Workers-only architecture
- **Phases defined**:
  - Phase 0: IIR Filter Validation (in progress)
  - Phase 1: Local Proof-of-Concept Tests
  - Phase 2: Cloudflare Infrastructure Tests
  - Phase 3: Integration & End-to-End Testing
  - Phase 4: Production Migration
  - Phase 5: Decommission Render
- **Key motivation**: Replace ObsPy's "lossy" FFT/IFFT method with IIR filters for true streaming capability
- **Cost benefit**: Eliminate Render backend (~$21/month) by moving all processing to Workers

#### 2. **Audification Test Implementation** ‚úÖ
- **Created**: `tests/test_audification_comparison.py`
- **Purpose**: Generate 4 audio files to compare different correction methods by ear
- **Test configuration**:
  - Station: `HV.OBL.HHZ` (Kilauea, Hawaii)
  - Duration: 1 hour (3600s ‚Üí 8.16s audified at 441√ó speedup)
  - Sample rate: 100 Hz
  - Time window: Historical data (48-47 hours ago) for full availability
- **Output files**:
  1. `1_raw_normalized.wav` - Raw seismic (instrument-filtered, baseline)
  2. `2_obspy_fft_corrected.wav` - ObsPy's FFT/IFFT deconvolution method
  3. `3_iir_bilinear_corrected.wav` - Our IIR bilinear transform approach
  4. `4_hp_filter_only.wav` - High-pass filter only (no instrument correction)

### Critical Learnings

#### 3. **Instrument Response Fundamentals** üéì
- **Forward response is flat in passband**: Seismometers have ~0 dB gain in their operating range (0.05-20 Hz)
- **Inverted response should also be flat**: Correct deconvolution produces ~0 dB corrections in passband
- **Poles tell corner frequency**: First pole pair magnitude determines low-frequency cutoff
  - HV.OBL: `|-0.0366 ¬± 0.037j| = 0.052 rad/s = 0.0083 Hz`
  - Instrument is flat above ~0.05 Hz, rolls off below
- **Zeros at origin**: Seismometers block DC (0 Hz) by design ‚Üí high-pass filter behavior

#### 4. **A0 Normalization Factor Bug** üêõ ‚Üí ‚úÖ
- **Initial error**: Attempted to invert `normalization_factor` (A0) as if it were a physical gain
  - Result: Inverted gain of `1/8.3e17 = 1.2e-18` ‚Üí massive +248 dB corrections ‚Üí essentially zeroed signal
- **Key insight**: **A0 is a mathematical normalization constant, NOT a physical gain to be inverted**
  - A0 is defined such that `|H(jœâ‚ÇÄ)| = 1` at normalization frequency œâ‚ÇÄ
  - It's already "baked into" the pole-zero geometry
  - Physical gains come from `stage_gain` and `instrument_sensitivity`
- **Correct approach**: Use `gain_inv = 1.0` in `bilinear_zpk`, then normalize SOS coefficients afterward
  - Find minimum gain in passband (e.g., -21.4 dB)
  - Scale SOS to bring minimum to 0 dB
  - Result: Flat 0 dB response in passband (correct!)

#### 5. **ObsPy `pre_filt` Parameter** üéì
- **Critical discovery**: ObsPy's `remove_response()` needs `pre_filt` to prevent amplifying noise
- **Parameter format**: `(f1, f2, f3, f4)` - cosine taper from f1‚Üíf2 and f3‚Üíf4
- **Our setting**: `(0.005, 0.01, 45.0, 49.0)` Hz
  - Tapers in: 0.005-0.01 Hz (protects DC/very low frequencies where gain explodes)
  - Tapers out: 45-49 Hz (protects Nyquist where noise dominates)
- **Why necessary**: Inverted instrument response has infinite gain at DC (due to zeros at origin in forward response)
- **Without this**: Deconvolution amplifies DC drift and noise by 10¬π¬≤ ‚Üí huge sinusoidal DC offset

#### 6. **Filter Order & Frequency Choices** üéØ
**High-pass filter (applied before deconvolution):**
- **Frequency**: 0.045 Hz seismic ‚Üí 20 Hz in audified audio (441√ó speedup)
- **Order**: 2nd-order Butterworth
- **Purpose**: 
  - Removes DC and sub-bass where instrument response is poor
  - Prevents infinite gain amplification in IIR deconvolution
  - Preserves low frequencies for "volcano ride" experience (user requirement)
- **Initial attempts**: Tried 0.01 Hz and 0.1 Hz, both had issues
  - 0.01 Hz: Still too close to DC, gains too extreme
  - 0.1 Hz: Cut too much desired low-frequency content
  - 0.045 Hz: **Goldilocks zone** - protects from DC issues while preserving rumble

**Low-pass anti-aliasing filter (applied after deconvolution):**
- **Frequency**: 47.6 Hz seismic ‚Üí 21 kHz in audified audio
- **Order**: 4th-order Butterworth
- **Purpose**: Remove aliasing artifacts that become more pronounced when user slows down audio
- **Applied to**: All 3 correction methods (#2, #3, #4) for fair comparison
- **Raw audio (#1)**: No filter applied (baseline)

**Removed filters:**
- **Initial bandpass (0.5-45 Hz)**: Removed after IIR deconvolution
  - User feedback: "the low frequencies seem a LOT LESS prevalent"
  - Requirement: Preserve low frequencies for immersive "volcano ride" experience
  - Solution: Use only high-pass at 0.045 Hz, no additional low-frequency attenuation

#### 7. **IIR Coefficient Normalization** üéöÔ∏è
- **Approach**: "Cut over boost" - audio engineering best practice
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Find minimum gain in passband (0.05-20 Hz)
  min_gain_db = -21.4  # Example
  scale_factor = 10**(-min_gain_db / 20)  # Linear scale
  sos[:, :3] *= scale_factor  # Scale b coefficients only
  ```
- **Result**: Minimum passband gain becomes 0 dB, others slightly negative
  - 0.5 Hz: 0.0 dB
  - 1.0 Hz: 0.0 dB
  - 5.0 Hz: -0.1 dB
  - 10.0 Hz: -0.2 dB
- **Why**: Flat response = no audible quality loss, only removes instrument coloration

#### 8. **Performance Analysis** ‚ö°
**IIR method timing (for 1 hour of seismic data):**
- Detrend + Taper: 3.6 ms
- High-pass filter: 3.0 ms
- IIR deconvolution: 6.9 ms
- Low-pass filter: 4.2 ms
- **TOTAL: 17.7 ms** (0.005 ms per second of seismic data)

**HP-only method timing:**
- **TOTAL: 11.4 ms** (0.003 ms per second of seismic data)

**Key insight**: Both methods are **extremely fast**
- 1 hour of seismic ‚Üí 17.7 ms processing
- Cloudflare Workers can easily handle this in real-time
- IIR overhead is only 6.3 ms (17.7 - 11.4) per hour
- Cost is negligible compared to benefits

**Implementation simplicity**:
- All operations are basic NumPy/SciPy functions
- Easily translatable to JavaScript (just array math)
- No FFTs, no heavy matrix operations
- Perfect for edge computing (Cloudflare Workers)

#### 9. **Multi-Station Validation** ‚úÖ
- **Tested 10 stations** across multiple volcanoes:
  - Kilauea: HV.OBL, HV.NPT, HV.BYL
  - Shishaldin: AV.SSLN, AV.SSLS
  - Spurr: AV.CKN, AV.CKL
  - Mauna Loa: HV.MLX, HV.MLON
  - Great Sitkin: AV.GSMY, AV.GSSP
- **Key findings**:
  - All stations have similar pole-zero structure (11 poles, 6 zeros typical)
  - All have zeros at origin (DC blocking)
  - All have flat passband response (~0 dB) above corner frequency
  - Corner frequencies vary slightly (0.008-0.01 Hz typical)
- **Conclusion**: IIR code is **broadly applicable** across all our volcanic monitoring stations
  - No need for station-specific tuning
  - Same normalization approach works universally
  - Filter parameters (0.045 Hz HP, 47.6 Hz LP) appropriate for all

### Technical Decisions

#### 10. **Data Type Management** üî¢
- **Processing**: Use `float32` or `float64` for all intermediate calculations
- **Output**: Convert to `int16` only at final audio saving step
- **Normalization**: Scale to ¬±32767 range at the very end
- **Why**: Prevents quantization errors and maintains precision through pipeline
- **MiniSEED input**: Int32 samples ‚Üí convert to float immediately

#### 11. **Anderson MCMC Method - Deferred** ‚è∏Ô∏è
- **Initial plan**: Use Anderson's pre-computed MCMC-optimized IIR coefficients from TDD R package
- **Issue encountered**: R environment dependencies (`RSEIS`, `pracma`, `Rwave`) failed to compile
- **Decision**: Replace 4th output file with "HP-only" method instead
  - More useful for comparison: isolates effect of HP filter vs. full correction
  - Avoids complex R environment setup for now
  - Can revisit MCMC later if bilinear proves insufficient (unlikely based on results)
- **HP-only value**: Shows what "no correction" + basic filtering sounds like
  - Helps answer: "Is instrument correction actually necessary?"
  - Provides another baseline for listening comparison

### Files Modified/Created

**New files:**
- `tests/test_audification_comparison.py` - Main audification test script
- `tests/audification_comparison/1_raw_normalized.wav` - Raw audio output

### Next Steps

#### Phase 0 Continuation:
- [ ] **Listening test**: Compare all 4 audio files by ear
  - Does raw data sound muddy/wrong?
  - Do corrected versions sound clearer?
  - Can you hear differences between FFT and IIR?
  - What does HP-only sound like vs. full correction?
  - Any obvious artifacts in FFT method?
- [ ] **Frequency response comparison**: Plot FFT vs. IIR vs. Anderson (if we set up R)
- [ ] **Time-domain waveform comparison**: Overlay FFT vs. IIR to check differences
- [ ] **Volcanic range (0.5-10 Hz) accuracy analysis**: Quantify how well each method preserves signal
- [ ] **Streaming viability test**: Process data chunk-by-chunk to confirm no boundary artifacts
- [ ] **Decision point**: Use bilinear transform or implement MCMC optimization?

#### Phase 1: Local Tests (after Phase 0 complete):
- [ ] IRIS transfer speed test (2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h chunks)
- [ ] miniSEED parser test (JavaScript)
- [ ] Int32 ‚Üí Int16 conversion test (JavaScript)
- [ ] IIR filter implementation (JavaScript `sosfilt` equivalent)
- [ ] Bilinear transform (JavaScript `zpk2sos` equivalent)

### Questions to Resolve
1. **Is IIR correction audibly better than HP-only?** If not, we can skip correction entirely and just use HP filter
2. **Does FFT method have obvious artifacts?** Listen for ringing, smearing, or other processing artifacts
3. **Should we pursue MCMC coefficients?** Or is bilinear "good enough" (likely yes based on flat 0 dB passband)
4. **Chunk size for streaming**: How much data should Workers fetch from IRIS at once?
